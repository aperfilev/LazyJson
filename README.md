# LazyJson Java Library

The LazyJson Java Library is a powerful and efficient tool designed to provide optimal parsing performance for JSON files. Parsing large JSON files can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, especially when dealing with complex structures. The LazyJson library aims to address this challenge by offering a lazy and incremental approach to JSON parsing, allowing you to access and process JSON data on-the-fly without loading the entire file into memory.

## Features

- **Lazy Parsing:** The library employs a lazy parsing technique, which means that it only reads and processes the necessary parts of the JSON file as requested, reducing memory usage and improving performance.

- **Incremental Processing:** LazyJson allows you to incrementally process JSON data, which is particularly useful when working with large files. You can extract and process data step by step, without the need to load the entire JSON file at once.

- **Efficient Memory Usage:** With its efficient memory management, LazyJson minimizes memory consumption by discarding already processed data and only holding the necessary portions in memory.

- **Support for Complex JSON Structures:** The library handles various JSON structures, including nested objects and arrays, ensuring that you can navigate and extract data from intricate JSON files with ease.

- **Simple API:** LazyJson provides a straightforward API that abstracts the complexities of lazy parsing. You can focus on processing your data without getting bogged down by low-level parsing details.

- **Error Handling:** The library includes comprehensive error handling mechanisms, allowing you to identify and address issues in your JSON data gracefully.

## Getting Started

To start using the LazyJson Java Library, follow these simple steps:

1. **Download the Library:** Download the LazyJson library JAR file from the [releases section](https://github.com/your-username/lazyjson/releases) of the GitHub repository.

2. **Add to Your Project:** Add the downloaded JAR file to your Java project's classpath.

3. **Import the Library:** Import the LazyJson classes in your Java code:

   ```java
   import com.lazyjson.LazyJsonParser;
   import com.lazyjson.LazyJsonObject;
   import com.lazyjson.exceptions.LazyJsonException;
   ```

4. **Initialize LazyJsonParser:** Create an instance of `LazyJsonParser` and provide the JSON file's input stream:

   ```java
   try {
       LazyJsonParser parser = new LazyJsonParser(new FileInputStream("path/to/your/json/file.json"));
   } catch (IOException e) {
       // Handle the exception
   }
   ```

5. **Access JSON Data:** Use the `LazyJsonParser` instance to extract and process JSON data:

   ```java
   try {
       LazyJsonObject jsonObject = parser.parseObject();
       String value = jsonObject.getString("key");
       // Process the value
   } catch (LazyJsonException e) {
       // Handle parsing exceptions
   }
   ```

6. **Incremental Processing:** Iterate through JSON arrays lazily:

   ```java
   try {
       while (parser.hasNext()) {
           LazyJsonObject item = parser.parseObject();
           // Process each array item
       }
   } catch (LazyJsonException e) {
       // Handle parsing exceptions
   }
   ```

7. **Close the Parser:** Ensure to close the parser when you're done processing the JSON file:

   ```java
   parser.close();
   ```
